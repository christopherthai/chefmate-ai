## Database Schema

## Constraints

- Prevent the submission of empty fields in critical areas such as ingredient lists and cooking instructions
- Limit the length of the search input to prevent overload of the system
- Use foreign keys with on-delete and on-update cascades appropriately to maintain referential integrity between tables such as users, recipes, and ingredients
- Ensure that primary keys (e.g., user ID, recipe ID, ingredient ID) are unique and automatically generated by the system
- Users can only edit or delete their own recipes

## Validations

- Check for valid email format and unique username
- The username and password of the user must be non-empty
- Verify user permissions for any CRUD operation on sensitive data like editing or deleting a recipe
- Ensure that ingredient names and recipe titles do not contain invalid characters and meet specified length requirements

## Stretch Goals

1. On the Explore Recipes Page, users browse through the recipes using various filters, such as cuisine, popularity, or recent additions.
2. Users can share their favorite recipes or their own creations directly from the application to social media platforms. The system provides easy-to-use sharing buttons on each recipe page, facilitating a broader community interaction and enabling users to discuss their culinary experiences.
3. Integrate a smart cooking timer that users can activate directly from the recipe details page. The timer can be set automatically based on the cooking times provided in the recipe or adjusted manually by the user.
4. Users can leave comments and ratings on Recipe Detail Page.
